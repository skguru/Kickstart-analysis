# Kickstart-analysis
Module 1 Challenge - performing analysis on kickstarter data
### Challenge

Analysis Summary based on outcomes vs goals and launch dates, following reasonable conclusions which includes limitations and suggestions for additional analysis:

-Kickstarter Campaigns for Plays with Goals greater than $15000 has 100% chance of success

-There are limitation of data and the corresponding analysis;  

Assumptions:  Launch date - when the play is launched; Deadline date- when the play is planned to be kicked off. If the deadline data is interpreted as the date by which the goal needs to be reached, then we need further analysis on the length of the campaign before coming to a reasonable conclusion.  

Following analysis need to happen before determing whether the length contributes to success or failure:

-Identify the lenghth of the campaign using launch date and deadline date

-Outcomes based on the launch date is on the parent category - which has other sub-category data that amounts to 1/3 of the total plays approximately. Remove the data set and analyse for further interpretation

-Identify whether success/failure relates to country, Launch period (Month) has any bearing to have a more meaningful conclusion; Further analysis on the percentage of success based on the month provides data point to the analysis which can be correlated to the success.  Outcomes based on launch date provides a view- greater success during the months of Apr-Jul, however failures do exist at the similar time frame.  It is non-conclusive at this point -needed further analysis.
